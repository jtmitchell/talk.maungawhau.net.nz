## Using AWS Lambda to run Python scripts

Slides for a lightning talk about running Python scripts from AWS Lambda.

<!--more-->

Lambda is Amazon's new service that allows execution of Java or Node.js functions
without having to deploy a full EC2 instance to run on.

Lambda is a compelling option for deploying endpoints for REST-based micro-services.

This lightning talk demonstrates how to use a Node.js wrapper to execute a
Python script.

Video of this talk from the [Auckland Python Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/NZPUG-Auckland/) is [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/aQjLaG5WdCg).
